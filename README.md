# MLGym
This repository shall contain implementation of algorithms and models in an attempt to understand machine learning better.
- MNIST: Contains my implementations of neural networks and softmax regression from scratch used on MNIST dataset alongwith implementations of CNN with PyTorch library.
- RL: A simple model for multi-armed bandit problem with various update methods.
