# Machine Learning on MNIST Dataset

- Softmax Regression From Scratch: Used softmax regression to classify the 10 digits from scratch using NumPy and preprocessing
    - Accuracy: 0.924
- Neural Network From Scratch: Implemented a 2 layers neural network using ReLU and Softmax activation functions with preprocessing
    - Accuracy: 0.9683
- SkLearn_LRC_SGDC : Used LogisticRegression Classifer and SGD Classifer from SkLearn libraries on MNIST with scaling
    -  Accuracy: 0.924
  
- You should unzip the ubyte zipped files before using them
